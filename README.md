## Installation & Setup

There are two options. By running Docker or precompiled binary for macOS below:

**Docker**

The easiest way to run the node in a docker container:

```
docker run -d copperbits/ton
```

You might want to run in interactive mode and mount current dir into the container to be able to compile fif files:

```
docker run -ti -v "$(pwd):/data" --name ton copperbits/ton
```

Compile a fif file (if your container is running and current dir is mounted):

```
docker exec ton fift test.fif
```

**Releases (macOS)**

[Lite Client Latest release](https://github.com/copperbits/TON/releases/tag/test-1)
