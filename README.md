- Step-by-step guide: **How to build a TON client**
- How to get test Grams
- Development:
  - Write first hello-world smart contract
  - How to deploy a smart contract
  - How to send transactions

**Also, you will find there:**
- Future releases of binaries
- A FAQ with most popular questions (WIP)

## Installation & Setup

There are two options. By running Docker or precompiled binary for macOS below:

**Docker**

The easiest way to run the node in a docker container:

```
docker run -d copperbits/ton
```

You might want to run in interactive mode and mount current dir into the container to be able to compile fif files:

```
docker run -ti -v "$(pwd):/data" --name ton copperbits/ton
```

Compile a fif file (if your container is running and current dir is mounted):

```
docker exec ton fift test.fif
```

**Releases (macOS)**

[Lite Client Latest release](https://github.com/copperbits/TON/releases/latest)

- Download [latest release](https://github.com/copperbits/TON/releases/)
- Go to command line, where binary placed
- Run:
```bash
./test-lite-client -C ton-lite-client-test1.config.json
```
- run `help` to get started

More detailed instruction you can find [here](/docs/Mac_tutorial.md).
